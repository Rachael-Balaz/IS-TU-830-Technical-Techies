<h2>Progress</h2>
<p>As the project progressed, we have made many adjustments to our originally planned timetable. There have been various changes due to unrealistic time management and the lack of communication from a few team members. We’ve had to adapt and adjust to these matters by working our way around a few things and making pivotal decisions to what we had initially set out to do. As mentioned previously in the project description, we’ve changed one of our MVF into an EVF, divided another into two separate MVFs, and combined another two MVFs into one. Amongst these significant changes, we’ve had to share more workload amongst 4/6 team members as there has been a considerable amount of miscommunication, however, despite having made these many adjustments we’ve still referred to the original plan here and there and worked in accordance to the milestones that we had planned.</p>
<p>The following table is a summary of our original plan in comparison to what we actually worked on each week for the duration of assignment 3. </p>

    Originally planned tasks:
    <ul>
  <li>Source assets</li>

   Actual assigned tasks:
   <ul>
  <li>Develop MVF (enemies)</li>

</ul>  
<p>Motivation, scope, aims & goals were not completed during this week and instead was pushed back because the member assigned to this task was MIA.</p>

  <tr>
    <td colspan="2">Compare & Contrast:
    <p>According to our original plan, we should have started on most of our MVFs assuming that every member would be learning to code in unity, however this was not the case as we did not accurately estimate how long each MVF would take to develop. 
</p>
<p>Instead, we adjusted the plan and aimed to complete most of the written section out the way first so that we don’t have to worry about it after.

  <li>Work on presentation section that was set to be due on the 19/10.</li>
</ul>  
<p>We have made a significant change to our original plan; where we have shuffled a few of our MVFs and EVFs around because we had overestimated the time that we had to work on developing our prototype.</p>

  <tr>
    <td colspan="2">Compare & Contrast:
    <p>During week 10, we made a significant change in our plan and that was to adjust our MVFs and EVFs around. We decided to remove the ‘game section 1’ MVF and change it into an EVF instead because making both a tutorial level and an actual game level would’ve taken up a lot of valuable time that could be used more efficiently (especially since most of the scenes would be quite similar anyways). We have also decided to separate enemies from traps as two separate MVFs, and combine death handling and health mechanic together. This made our workload more realistic and workable. We managed to make a start on 3 more MVFs and tackle most of the written report section.</p>
<p>Another thing that was not included in our original plan for week 10 was working on the presentation section. Before we were aware of any dates, we were unsure of when the presentation section was set to be due hence, we never included it into our plan. We began working on it early during week 10 because the announced date was the day after we were to submit our assignment 3, on the 19/10.</p>

    <td colspan="2">Compare & Contrast:
    <p>In the original plan, we had given ourselves extra things to work on and develop as we assumed that we’d have enough time to finish everything early. Though in reality, during this week we continued working on both our final MVF (the tutorial scene) and the report section of the assignment. Some of the written tasks that were previously assigned in week 10, were repeatedly assigned again this week because they were given to a different team member to work on. There has been a lack of communication and contribution from a few members so it was necessary for us to adjust and share the workload.</p>
<p>By the end of the week we were able to complete most of the written section.

<p>This final week mainly focused on gathering all the work that we have done for this assignment into one document, finalise any last fixes/changes to our game prototype & making sure everything works so that we’re able to submit.

<p>There was also an announcement that the presentation section due date has been extended, hence why we have not worked on it during week 12.

    <p>In the final week that we’ve had to work on this project, we aimed to finalise all the tasks that we’ve worked on thus far and combine it all into one document. We prioritised completing our prototype and validating it. We had also brushed up on the remaining tasks left of our report section and evaluated each other via SparkPlus.</p>
<p>For the final week, we worked accordingly to our original plan and that was to complete and test our prototype, code the assignment document and submit on time.
