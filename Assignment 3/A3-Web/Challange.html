        <p>The group had some initial issues collaborating together as we had just met and needed to start work immediately. With no clearly defined roles between us, this problem caused some minor communication issues. When the roles were more defined, we had an easier time giving clear instructions to one another. Another issue we came across, communication-wise, was members not communicating absences from meetings. This has caused an unreliable work schedule and has not been fixed.</p>
        <p>In our planning stage, everyone came together with their own ideas. We talked about what we wanted the project to look like and the features within it. However, with the amount of ideas between us and without having taken notes, confusion between the team on what the project looked like happened. This caused many discussions throughout the project on what the features looked like which could have been avoided.</p>
        <p>Due to inexperience, the group underestimated what it would take to complete the project. Adding onto a large scope, when work finished slower than expected, it caused us to re-evaluate the scope of the project.</p>
        <p>Long and I joined the other group members a week into the project start which caused the team to play “catch-up” in planning the project. I believe the group came to a quick decision on our project but due to this, I think we didn’t have a clear goal.</p>
        <p>Within the group, only myself and Long had experience working on game projects beforehand. This was a relatively minor issue as the group was eager to learn and Long and I gave tutorials and assistance to other members who needed help, especially with specific programs like Unity or Blender.</p>

        <h3>• What have you found easy? What have you found difficult? What was unexpected? In what ways have you been stretched? Note that these challenges will likely vary for each person in the group. Only say the group found something challenging if all of you had an issue. Use Tables to summarise.</h3>
        <p>In my opinion, I don't find any specific tasks is either easy or difficult, there just a lot of things need to be done and nothing was unexpected since they all been predicted before it could happen.
        </p>
        <p>However, in term of a group, we do have some challenges. One of them is due to different reasons, a few of our teammates couldn't join the meeting very often so there was a lot of stuff that we needed to catch up and worried about. Luckily, before the due came they did manage to submit their work in time and we managed to address that issue.</p>
        <h3>• What challenges were you expecting? What have you done to address these? Have they been overcome?</h3>
        <p>One of the challenges that I was expecting is how much the workload needed to be done. To be honest, its a huge amount of workload that a university student can handle during a full-load semester. In order to solve this challenge, I have to spend more extra times, reduced less important workflow or replacing them with acceptable assets. Thankfully during our planning stage, I already aware these potentials challenges and have enough times to address them early enough.</p>
        <h3>• What are the new skills or experience you have learned and/or developed? Include those that haven't worked out. For example, using a particular tool but finding that it won't work in the way you anticipated.</h3>
        <p>I have able to acknowledge deeper in 3D software Zbrush, Maya, Blender as for programming during this semester I also developed more experience in web programming as well as game programming. </p>
        <h3>• Plans change, did yours? (plans can change in more ways that simply the timetable. For example, your aims and/or goals change, or roles change, or unanticipated events). In hindsight, would you make any changes to your plan now? Have things turned out as you expected? What would you do differently if you had your time over again?</h3>
        <p>I'm participated most of the roles in our project from programmer to designer and this is not the first time I have done this so before the project started most of the predicted challenges that had been aware and adjusted before they happened as I expected so there is nothing to be concerned. I'm did everything at my very best for this project so even if I had time over again I would do it the same.</p>
        
        <h3>• Was your timetable realistic? What would you change in your timetable, knowing what you do now? Justify your answer.</h3>
        <p>As mentioned before, i did have experiences in current workflow so the timetable is 99% has been processed well.</p>
        <h3>• Have the tools and technologies worked out as expected? Have any of the risks you identified materialised?</h3>
        <p>Yes they all worked well as expected. No, it hasn't.</p>
        <h3>Have there been unanticipated events affecting your progress? </h3>
        <p>No, there haven't.</p>

        <p>Prior to working on this project I thought that working with a group of people I’ve never met or have even seen before would be difficult. I didn’t have many expectations, but I wasn’t sure how the group dynamic would be since, in the previous semester I was able to work in a group with my friends that I’ve met prior to any tasks that were assigned. However, after having met each group member, I found it easy to get along with everyone and seek help if I ever needed any.</p>

        <p>Some of the challenges that I was expecting when working on this project was mostly time management. I was worried that we have overlooked the amount of work versus the amount of time we actually have to complete each task, however this was easily resolved by making minor adjustments to our project plans so that we’re able to produce enough quality work within the remaining time we have left.</p>
        
        <p>The timetable that we have developed at the beginning of the project seemed realistic at the time, however that was produced without the consideration of any other external factors that could have gotten in the way of our work. Looking back at it now, there would definitely be changes to how much work we set ourselves each week - something more realistically and easily achievable.</p>
        
        <p>Despite all the challenges and obstacles that we may have faced, working together with the team ‘Technical Techies’ I was able to learn a lot and develop both my HTML skills and time management. </p>
