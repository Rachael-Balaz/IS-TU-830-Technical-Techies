<h1>Beyond Current Capabilities</h1>

<p>Each member of the group has different current capabilities. For example, Nathan has completed an advanced diploma of game development, whereas Long spent 6 months developing a game within the Introduction to I.T course. The rest of the group members have had sparse experience of programming and game development, which means that the completion of this project will teach them valuable skills relevant to creating a game. For instance, navigating Unity and developing expertise with a programming language like C++ would be invaluable in the personal development of the members working on this assignment in these areas. Additionally, despite Nathan and Long’s proficiency and experience within I.T, they might need to improve their design skills. Some members within the group excel at that, which means they can teach them how to be more effective designers..</p>

<h1>Project Risks</h1>
<p>There are various risks related to the assignment requirements. Firstly, there may be problems associated with creating and coding the game. For example, mapping the character movements to specific keys on a keyboard and ensuring that the input by the user is reflected in the feedback of the program. Secondly, there might be bugs associated with the creation of the game. These could include but are not limited to graphical errors related to the sprites not working as intended, gameplay mechanics not functioning as part of the intended design, and sound queues not playing when prompted due to a corrupted file. Thirdly, only a few members within the group have personal experience with creating games. Although these members can serve as a mentor for the other group members and provide valuable learning experiences for them, this also means they might not be able to produce work to the standard of those with expertise can.</p>

<p>There could be some potential risks associated with the social dynamics within the team. For example, due to the COVID-19 crisis, there might be some unexpected issues that arise within people’s lives that prevent them from being able to work on the project. This issue can be monitored via the correspondence with each group member in the team and can be minimised by providing the appropriate support to the affected recipient. The recipient also needs to conform to applicable medical directions and general health advice if they want to maximise their recovery. Additionally, a group member may voluntarily decide to stop attending meetings either because they want to drop out of university or another reason. This can be monitored through recording the odd person out either mentally or in written form who is not attending each meeting, and messaging them to confirm whether everything is okay associated with the assignment and the team. However, if someone experiences a severe depressive episode, bout of lethargy, or drops out of university without informing the rest of the team or keeping in contact with them, there is no way to avoid this. Working extra hard and reorganising work delegation is the logical course of action in the event something like this happens and keeping your tutor updated on the situation. Finally, perhaps certain group members are introverted and may be hesitant to express their ideas. This restricted expression of ideas can be mitigated by having a supportive, respectful and thoughtful meeting environment which would encourage optimal meetings.</p>
