<h2> User-stories – MV5 </h2>
<p> As a new gamer, I want a relaxed gaming experience. This means that the obstacles I encounter should be very forgiving and not punishing towards the player. For this reason, there should potentially be an “easy” difficulty, in which the potency of each traps should be severely mitigated.</p>

<p> As a casual gamer, I want a balanced sense of challenge. This means that I do not want something too difficult, but also not too easy. Therefore, the obstacles should provide somewhat of a challenge to casual gamers without being too hard that it is unaccessible to them. </p>

<p> As an experienced gamer, I want a hardcore challenge. This entails that I want a gruelling and difficult game to play. This can manifest through various difficulty settings, and how they can affect the properties of each of the traps or obstacles in their potency.</p>
