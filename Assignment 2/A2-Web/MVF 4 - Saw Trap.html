<h1>MVF 4 - Enemies and Traps - Saw Trap</h1>
<p>The Saw Trap is a rarer obstacle the player character will come across on their journey, this trap will be clearly visible and intuitive to the player as it will look different from the normal floor tiles/ game background. The Blade/Saw will run on its programmed tracks continuously back and forth at interchangeable speeds making it easier to adjust the difficulty of the game. Since this trap will be constantly moving around, likely at high speeds, the “traps effective area” is significantly larger than the spike trap, therefore the consequence of coming in contact with the trap for the player, will be less severe as it is easier to make mistakes as the player. The player will lose a portion of their health, and become invulnerable for a second, giving them time to move past the trap and decreasing the chances of being damaged twice by the same trap. </p>
<p>The Design of this trap was mainly inspired by the well-known platforming game “Hollow Knight”, with a trap that can have its speed and a large effective area adjusted to the designers whims, allows the creator of the levels more control over the difficulty of the level design. Since this trap is very versatile, and matches the design of the spike trap, it perfectly conforms to the medieval fantasy castle theme we are going with.</p>
<p>As a Player of the game “Plunderer”, I need to run/jump past the moving saw trap without touching them in order to achieve the current objective and progress the story of the game. Meaning that the successful implementation of the saw trap can be validated by having the player character touch the saw trap. If the trap is moving along its designed rout and reduces the players health upon contact, then the trap is working as intended.</p>
