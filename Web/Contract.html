<h1>Group Contract</h1>
<p>The following list of expectations and rules will make up the group contract that our team members are expected to abide by. This list was created during our first team meeting with input from all members. This will ensure that all members find the expectations fair and will contribute equally to the project.</p>
<h1>5 Main Ground Rules</h1>
<p>1. Attend all meetings (2 per week) â€“ in case a member is unable to attend, members are expected to notify their peers in advance. Any missed group meetings must be watched by the missing participant.</p>
<p>2. Don't be late any meetings.</p>
<p>3. Complete all delegated work within the given timeframe.</p>
<p>4. All members are expected to check and respond to the group within 12 hours at most.</p>
<p>5. If a member is unsure of how to complete a task or needs help, make sure to reach out to the group for assistance. Other members are expected to help members struggling.</p>
<p>The group has agreed to use Microsoft Teams as the main form of communication to hold meetings and message each other about the project. In order to keep track of the progress of the project, members will use Trello to mark progress. In case of unexpected problems that might arise, any issues that affects the productivity of the group will be brought up by members during group meetings to be addressed. In case of conflict between members, or members not completing their designated work, Group meetings will be held to address the lack of progress from the group member. Ultimately all decisions for the project will be decided by majority vote and all members will have a say in the direction of the project.</p>
<p>The following delegation of Assignment1 work has been approved by everyone in a group meeting.</p>
