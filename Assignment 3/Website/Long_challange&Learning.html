<h3>• What have you found easy? What have you found difficult? What was unexpected? In what ways have you been stretched? Note that these challenges will likely vary for each person in the group. Only say the group found something challenging if all of you had an issue. Use Tables to summarise.</h3>
<p>In my opinion, I don't find any specific tasks is either easy or difficult, there just a lot of things need to be done and nothing was unexpected since they all been predicted before it could happen.
</p>
<p>However, in term of a group, we do have some challenges. One of them is due to different reasons, a few of our teammates couldn't join the meeting very often so there was a lot of stuff that we needed to catch up and worried about. Luckily, before the due came they did manage to submit their work in time and we managed to address that issue.</p>
<h3>• What challenges were you expecting? What have you done to address these? Have they been overcome?</h3>
<p>One of the challenges that I was expecting is how much the workload needed to be done. To be honest, its a huge amount of workload that a university student can handle during a full-load semester. In order to solve this challenge, I have to spend more extra times, reduced less important workflow or replacing them with acceptable assets. Thankfully during our planning stage, I already aware these potentials challenges and have enough times to address them early enough.</p>
<h3>• What are the new skills or experience you have learned and/or developed? Include those that haven't worked out. For example, using a particular tool but finding that it won't work in the way you anticipated.</h3>
<p>I have able to acknowledge deeper in 3D software Zbrush, Maya, Blender as for programming during this semester I also developed more experience in web programming as well as game programming. </p>
<h3>• Plans change, did yours? (plans can change in more ways that simply the timetable. For example, your aims and/or goals change, or roles change, or unanticipated events). In hindsight, would you make any changes to your plan now? Have things turned out as you expected? What would you do differently if you had your time over again?</h3>
<p>I'm participated most of the roles in our project from programmer to designer and this is not the first time I have done this so before the project started most of the predicted challenges that had been aware and adjusted before they happened as I expected so there is nothing to be concerned. I'm did everything at my very best for this project so even if I had time over again I would do it the same.</p>

<h3>• Was your timetable realistic? What would you change in your timetable, knowing what you do now? Justify your answer.</h3>
<p>As mentioned before, i did have experiences in current workflow so the timetable is 99% has been processed well.</p>
<h3>• Have the tools and technologies worked out as expected? Have any of the risks you identified materialised?</h3>
<p>Yes they all worked well as expected. No, it hasn't.</p>
<h3>Have there been unanticipated events affecting your progress? </h3>
<p>No, there haven't.</p>
