        <h1>Future Developments</h1>
        <p>The prototype of the project is just that, a prototype. It only shows a minute amount of the enormous potential the game concept has. By adding in more game mechanics, levels and even characters to further develop the games lore, the game could become so much more. The prototype is simply a demonstration that the project is achievable, without the tight project time constraints the game could become so much more than the prototype. </p>
        <p>If the project attracts attention and funding for further development, new project outcomes and goals would have to be set. These goals are the checkpoints to ensure that the project is developing successfully. The first and most major of the four main checkpoints is the production of the Beta of the game, this means almost all if not all the game mechanics and game levels are incorporated. The second checkpoint is the BGM and in game audio matches the location and events happening to the player. The third checkpoint is the art style and art direction are consistent with the events of the game. The last checkpoint is the development of advanced levels and logic puzzles that involve the game mechanics. These goals/checkpoints do not have a specific order in which they need to be completed, however when they are met, it will indicate the project has developed successfully.</p>
        <p>In order to meet these goals four project positions, need to be filled. These roles are the Programmer, Level Designer, Artist and Sound Engineer. Each position will need to work together with each other to meet the new project outcomes. </p>
        <p>The Programmer would oversee mainly the coding of the game which means they must have advanced programming expertise especially when it comes to programming in unity as that is the platform, we have chosen to base the project on. This correlates to the project outcome of producing a playable Beta version of the game that includes most if not all the game mechanics and levels. This would be the project outcome the programmer should try to achieve.</p>
        <p>The Artists main project outcome to oversee would be to make sure the art style and direction remains consistent; this means the game assets need to look detailed without the assets looking inconsistent with the background assets. This requires the artist to be skilled in electronic art, more specifically game asset creation meaning the artist needs to both be skilled in drawing and working with electronics.The artist would also need to collaborate with the team a lot, therefore they are required to have teamwork experience.</p>
        <p>The level designers would oversee creating and designing all the levels in the game. Since “Plunderer” is a platformer, with each level progressed by the player, the difficulty should increase significantly. This difficulty should come in more and more advanced logic and platforming puzzles. In order to make sure the levels do not feel repetitive, a skilled designer with expertise in level creation is required. Ideally the level designer is innovative in their thinking and have team-work experience so they can work together with the Artist to ensure the consistency of the level design and art theme.</p>
        <p>The Sound Designer would mainly oversee the project outcome of the BGM and game sound effects creation. Not only do the sound effects need to match the actions of the characters, the BGM needs to match the theme and tone of the events the player is currently going though. Meaning that each area with a new “theme” should have music to convey the tone and atmosphere of the location. This would require collaboration with almost all the other positions, meaning teamwork experience is vital. The sound designer should also have experience in music and sound effects creation.</p>
