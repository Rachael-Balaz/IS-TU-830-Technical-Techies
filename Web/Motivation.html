            <h1>Project Motivation</h1>
            <p>Since all our group members have grown up in contact with lots of different games, during our first meeting our team decided that we wanted to create a game for our project. Games usually require more work and a wider variety of skills; this was the main reason we decided to make a game instead of an application for the project. We believe that the challenge of making a game will allow us to learn and improve our skills, in both creative design and game programming. Our team eventually decided to make a 2.5D platformer adventure game, which consists of the adventurer, controlled by the user, solving platforming and logic puzzles while avoiding traps and moving obstacles..</p>
            <p>The decision to make a 2.5D platformer game was not made lightly; we surveyed our close friends and families for their opinions on different genres of games. As expected, opinions differed greatly between each participant, some only like certain genres, while others were open to all types but would reserve their judgement only after they have tried the game. What was clear however was that ultimately there were a few key aspects that a game had to get right in order to be appealing to the participant. While the usual key aspects important in a good game like beautiful visuals and interesting gameplay elements where obvious, what was less obvious but equally important was that players wanted a challenge. Ultimately games are considered a pastime or relaxation tool, so usually games are designed with different difficulties for players to choose. However recent trends have shown that players also like playing challenging or “hardcore only” games where there is only one difficulty level. While difficult and time consuming to win, the process of struggling and eventually overcoming the challenge gives players a sense of accomplishment, as long as the game is not unfair, meaning that winning is always possible, only mechanically challenging, players will keep playing as long as they are interested in the game design. So, after intense group discussion we decided that a 2.5D platforming puzzle game would perfectly suit our project. Not only will a platforming game provide the challenge aspect that is needed to satisfy the player, most people who play games would have played similar games before and thus intuitively understand most of the mechanics. Platformers are also easier to make in general compared to other genres like First person shooters or strategy games. Due to the limited time we have, to complete the project, we decided that a 2.5D platformer adventure game was the best choice..</p>
            <p>Since our team is a mix of semi experience and completely new IT students, we believe the challenge of making a game would allow those who are less experienced to learn and improve our programming skills, while giving the more experienced members a chance to improve their delegation and leadership skills. Those who have more experience will be required to step up to help those who are less experienced to sharpen their programming skills..</p>
