<h3>Scope</h3>
<p>The scope of our project was to complete the opening section (i.e. tutorial) for our game. The features that are shown off within this section are the moving player character which the person playing directly influences their movement as well as enemies and traps to create danger for the player. Tied to these features are the health mechanic, that is tied to the player character who loses health when they run into the enemies or traps, in addition to the death mechanic which shows the death screen when the player loses all their health and allows the player to respawn.</p>
