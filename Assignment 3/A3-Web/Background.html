       <h1>PROJECT DESCRIPTION</h1>
       <h2>Plunderer is a PC platformer game made by Technical Techies. Control the knight and make your way through the castle to obtain all the treasure your heart's desires</h2>
        <p>Using the Unity, a game making engine that utilises the language C#, the knight will be controlled by players using the keyboard and mouse to move across the level, jump from platform to platform, dodge enemies, and collect items. Making use of Unity's inbuilt physics engine, the knight will jump and fall in a realistic way, in accordance to a gravity variable. Set in a fantasy world, environments, the knight, enemies and items will be designed around this setting to create an immersive experience.</p>
        
        <h1>Motivation</h1>
        <p>The motivation behind undergoing this project has multiple reasons.</p>
        <p>Firstly, collaboratively working on this project taught teamwork skills. The team had to organise themselves, schedule weekly meetings, outline expectations, and coordinate each other to be assigned to working on specific tasks. A sense of trust and reliance was built upon the group members, and the group were expected to respond to any messages sent within 24 hours. This project also fostered a sense of management and organisation through the use of Trello and Microsoft Teams, and more.</p>
        <p>Secondly, this project had practical value in creating a game. Learning the theory behind game design is much different to participating in its creation process. The team learnt how to use Unity, create assets, and use various sorts of tools such as Trello and Microsoft Teams to their advantage of creating a cohesive game.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Thirdly, the project taught valuable I.T skills and imparted important knowledge about the industry. The team familiarised themselves with Unity, Blender for the development of the assets and mechanics, and Visual Studio Code in coding the scripts for the game. Nathan and Long provided valuable key insights into the nature of game development for the rest of the team and personally taught the rest of the team how to use the various functions within Unity.</p>

        <h1>Aims & Goals</h1>
        <p>Firstly, a goal of this assignment is to complete as much of the work as possible before the final deadline. This might mean making adjustments to some of the workload that’s expected from each member of the team, simplifying work in order to be more efficient, or involving some Extended Viable Features into the Minimum Viable Features, which actually did happen.</p>
        <p>Secondly, another aim of this assignment is to maintain and facilitate the organisation of the team. We have established a system of accountability among our teammates, in which we need to inform the rest of the team if we cannot attend a meeting, or complete an allotment of work. If we do not meet these standards, we are prompted by our teammates to catch up on prior meetings. However, if even this is not met, then the tutor is informed, and then the tutor decides how to handle the situation.</p>
        <p>Thirdly, at its core, this is a learning assignment. Therefore, the goal of this assignment is to learn as much as possible about networking with teammates and having potential access to their network, learning about coding and how to practically transform that into creating a game, and familiarising one self with game creation softwares such as Unity.</p>
        <p>Firstly, the overarching aim of this assignment is to create a functional 2.5 D platformer game. The idea behind this is that there is meant to be an explorer who initially starts in a village and then is lead to a Castle in order to plunder it for treasure. It is for this reason, that the title of this game is: “Plunderer.” Inspiration was taken from Mario, the Metroidvania Series and Hollow Knight, which informed some of the stylistic art and mechanic decisions that we agreed on during the development of the game.</p>
        <p>Secondly, a more specific aim is to collaborate with the rest of the team to create authentic and original assets to be used in the game. Programs such as Unity and Blender have been utilised for this purpose. Additional concept art has also been produced in order to assist with this goal by providing a reference point for how the assets should be created and modeled after.</p>
        <p>Thirdly, we want to consolidate the coding architecture and optimise it for the purposes of having a smooth and responsive game. This will involve tinkering in Visual Studio Code and editing the Unity “scene” that was pushed to Github.</p>

        <h1>Scope</h1>
        <p>Throughout the course of the assignment, the group did experience scope creep, as well as scope contraction.</p>
        <p>Firstly, considering we had a multitude of ideas regarding itemised implementation, certain traps, enemies types, and other levels, we had to push it to the Extended Viable Features (Efs) in order to optimise work completion by the deadline.</p>
        <p>Secondly, scope contraction did happen throughout the course of the assignment. This lends itself to windfall, since we had to zero in on our scope and be more specific with what the group wanted for the final product of the game. For example, we simplified the amount of traps we were using and limited it to just 2, for each level that we were going to create.</p>
