        <h4>Interest</h4>
        <p>Coming from a previous degree in game development, creating games has always been interesting to me. Creating a platformer game is also something I have not done myself and seems like a fairly fun project.</p>
        
        <h4>Previous Skills</h4>
        <p>I have experience using Unity to develop games and C# as a programming language. I’ve used these when working with a group to create games collaboratively. Source control was a very important part of my previous projects and while I have not used Github for this purpose, the functionality is similar.</p>
        
        <h4>Acquired Skills</h4>
        <p>I have become more confident in leading a team as well as expressing my opinion.</p>
        
        <h4>Assigned Role</h4>
        <p>My assigned role for the project was team lead, as I was one of two people with previous experience on this type of project. This involved leading team meetings to keep them structured, assigning work to be done for the week and helping others with issues that come up. I’ve also used my previous skills to program features for the project and to help others with their own programming.</p>

        <p>Before taking the project my interest is Game Designer which is a person who has knowledge about game coding and designing however at that time both of my skill is not balanced, my design aspect was a bit lower than coding.</p>
        <p>To be more clear,  I think my weak points are in-depth of the fundamental of art since I'm don't have an art background and I started to have interest in them this year. Furthermore, since I have been self-learning so I may have not got to know the industry-standard skills better than other university students of that major. Another weakness of me that I think of that is since as a solo developer I have to learn everything that is needed to make a game so even though I can use a variety of different type of software to create a certain quality of works but I don't specialise in any specific skills for game development.</p>
        <p>Thought out this project I'm hoping that I have more chances to practice my modelling skills as well as become better as using Unity since Unity functionality is massive. Throughout the project, as a Game Designer and Programmer, Web programmer by getting evolved more in the intense workload, I got a chance to pushed myself further. Even though I tried to surpass weakness is designing but I also don't forget to improve my coding like C#, HTML, CSS, Javascript. </p>

        <p>My passion for IT stems from me being a creative person but it also stems from the idea that technology has the ability to significantly impact lives and I also aspire to make a great impact in my future career. I am particularly interested in design as it has more room for expressiveness and allows me to use my creativity to solve problems when necessary.</p>
        
        <p>My skills prior to working on this project included basic programming in HTML and JAVA language that I have learnt from the previous semester. My strength lies more in the design aspect of things, specifically digital illustration using Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator and Procreate. Through the completion of this project, I hope to improve my programming skills and broaden my scope of knowledge.</p>
        
        <p>My main role for this project is to design a few of the assets and maintain group organisation. I mostly worked on designing characters that would be included into the game such as the main player character and some enemies. With regards to maintaining group organisation, I often took the lead in setting ourselves dates and deadlines so that we each knew what needed to be completed and when it needed to be completed. We were able to complete all tasks on time whilst taking into consideration external factors. In addition to these roles, I have also worked on each few of the written sections for each assignment that lead up to this project.</p>

      <p>My ethnic background is a mix between Italian and British. I am passionate in the gaming industry within I.T. Additionally, Java and functional programming like F# has been fascinating to learn. </p>
      <p>I am still considered a beginner in programming and I.T but I am excited to learn more about programming and how to make video games, like through unity.
      </p>
      <p>I hope to develop vital skills and experience relevant to creating video games throughout the course of this assignment. The way I see this happening is using the unity engine to create assets, mechanics, scripts and content with supplementary programming through collaboration with my group members.
      </p>
      <p>Throughout the third part of this project, I will be endeavouring to learn C# and become involved in the creation of the scripts with the rest of the team. I am very excited to work on this and I think this will be an invaluable learning experience for me.</p>

      <h4>Interest </h4>
      <p>Growing up around games and electronics, creating and designing games has always been what I wanted to do. Being able to create and show others a whole different world has always been my motivation. I want to be able to entertain people with my creations.</p>
      <h4>Acquired Skills</h4>
      <p>I have little experience using the Unity platform and only used C# programming language a few times. While I may be lacking in technical expertise, I will make up with hard work and diligence. I can work well in a team, and always willing to learn new things.</p>
      <h4>Assigned Role </h4>
      <p>My Assigned Role was assistant game programmer and assistant to creative game director/designer, I was mainly required to do the brainstorming and creation of the game mechanics.  I also helped with the programming and scripting of the game.
