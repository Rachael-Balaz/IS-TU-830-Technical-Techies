       <h1>PROJECT DESCRIPTION</h1>
       <h2>Plunderer is a PC platformer game made by Technical Techies. Control the treasure bandit and make your way through the castle to obtain all the riches and fortune your heart desires!</h2>
        <p>Using Unity, a game making engine that utilises the language C#, the treasure bandit will be controlled by players using the keyboard and mouse to move across the level, jump from platform to platform, dodge enemies, and collect items. Making use of Unity's inbuilt physics engine, the treasure bandit will jump and fall in a realistic way, in accordance to a gravity variable. Set in a fantasy world, environments, the treasure bandit, enemies and items will be designed around this setting to create an immersive experience.</p>
        
        <h1>Motivation</h1>
        <p>The motivation behind undergoing this project has multiple reasons.</p>
        <p>Firstly, collaboratively working on this project taught teamwork skills. The team had to organise themselves, schedule weekly meetings, outline expectations, and coordinate each other to be assigned to working on specific tasks. A sense of trust and reliance was built upon the group members, and the group were expected to respond to any messages sent within 24 hours. This project also fostered a sense of management and organisation through the use of Trello and Microsoft Teams, and more.</p>
        <p>Secondly, this project had practical value in creating a game. Learning the theory behind game design is much different to participating in its creation process. The team learnt how to use Unity, create assets, and use various sorts of tools such as Trello and Microsoft Teams to their advantage of creating a cohesive game.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Thirdly, the project taught valuable I.T skills and imparted important knowledge about the industry. The team familiarised themselves with Unity, Blender for the development of the assets and mechanics, and Visual Studio Code in coding the scripts for the game. Nathan and Long provided valuable key insights into the nature of game development for the rest of the team and personally taught the rest of the team how to use the various functions within Unity.</p>

        <h1>Aims & Goals</h1>
        <p>Firstly, a goal of this assignment is to complete as much of the work as possible before the final deadline. This might mean making adjustments to some of the workload that’s expected from each member of the team, simplifying work in order to be more efficient, or involving some Extended Viable Features into the Minimum Viable Features, which actually did happen.</p>
        <p>Secondly, another aim of this assignment is to maintain and facilitate the organisation of the team. We have established a system of accountability among our teammates, in which we need to inform the rest of the team if we cannot attend a meeting, or complete an allotment of work. If we do not meet these standards, we are prompted by our teammates to catch up on prior meetings. However, if even this is not met, then the tutor is informed, and then the tutor decides how to handle the situation.</p>
        <p>Thirdly, at its core, this is a learning assignment. Therefore, the goal of this assignment is to learn as much as possible about networking with teammates and having potential access to their network, learning about coding and how to practically transform that into creating a game, and familiarising one self with game creation softwares such as Unity.</p>
        <p>Firstly, the overarching aim of this assignment is to create a functional 2.5 D platformer game. The idea behind this is that there is meant to be an explorer who initially starts in a village and then is lead to a Castle in order to plunder it for treasure. It is for this reason, that the title of this game is: “Plunderer.” Inspiration was taken from Mario, the Metroidvania Series and Hollow treasure bandit, which informed some of the stylistic art and mechanic decisions that we agreed on during the development of the game.</p>
        <p>Secondly, a more specific aim is to collaborate with the rest of the team to create authentic and original assets to be used in the game. Programs such as Unity and Blender have been utilised for this purpose. Additional concept art has also been produced in order to assist with this goal by providing a reference point for how the assets should be created and modeled after.</p>
        <p>Thirdly, we want to consolidate the coding architecture and optimise it for the purposes of having a smooth and responsive game. This will involve tinkering in Visual Studio Code and editing the Unity “scene” that was pushed to Github.</p>

        <h1>Scope</h1>
        <p>The scope of our project was to complete the opening section (i.e. tutorial) for our game. The features that are shown off within this section are the moving player character which the person playing directly influences their movement as well as enemies and traps to create danger for the player. Tied to these features are the health mechanic, that is tied to the player character who loses health when they run into the enemies or traps, in addition to the death mechanic which shows the death screen when the player loses all their health and allows the player to respawn.</p>

        <h1>Project Processes</h1>
        <p>Our project has been a great learning experience for us. The main learning experience has been to stay organised. To know what has to be done, what is being worked on and what has been finished helps our team stay on top of the project. In terms of what worked for our group, allocating tasks to members from what needed to be done helped our productivity a lot. What we had difficulty with was breaking down tasks in terms of what is needed especially early into the project. We had many ideas individually, but it was hard to agree on things as a team.</p>
        <p>Our group used our mentor in order to clarify assignment related questions. Our mentor also helped guide us to resources to help with the assignments. Communication within the team happened through Microsoft Teams. We used this to discuss amongst ourselves as well as to hold both formal (recorded) meetings and informal (non-recorded) meetings. There have been some issues regarding this, but they have been mostly extenuating circumstances and as such, no changes have been made in how we communicate.</p>
        <p>The most important aspect of creating a game project is being very clear in terms of the aim and features of the project. This allows group members to be more independent in the planning and design process. If we were to do the project again, there won’t be many changes as creating game projects require very specific roles that separate the work which we were unable to do based on assignment specifications. For example, there would be set artists that create art assets, programmers that implement the game features, and designers that create the features and tone of the game (with input from others).</p>
        <p>With a short amount of time to work on the project, make sure to stick to a small scope as creating games can cause a large amount of scope changes. It’s better to start with a smaller project and add to it then it is to create a larger project and not finish it.</p>
