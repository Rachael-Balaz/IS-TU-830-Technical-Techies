          <p>For the first week of the design process, each member will be working on designing the characters, game interface and assets. Majority of our team members have suggested that they lack in the area of design and hope to develop their skills, therefore balancing the design workload amongst each other allows everyone to work on something that they wish to improve on. There are also members of the team who have mentioned that they're more confident with designing things and have the role of refining the designs that each member contributes as this fit best with their capabilities. In regards to the timeline, it is ideal to have the base of our designs completed earlier on so that we can build on and work with our developed characters and game interface throughout the next following weeks.</p>

This allows each member to work on developing their design skills and have them become for familiar with the aesthetic of the game that we aim to produce. Everyone will contribute to writing the narrative descriptions for both of our prototypes; the tutorial level and the game section as this requires a team effort and for all of us to mutually agree on what we would like to present. 
          Working along side a given timeline, we aim to complete all design concepts within the first two weeks because it'll give us a better understanding of the game and what we would like the tutorial level and game section to appear like.

Working together like this allows us to evenly distribute our capabilities and everyone will have a chance to work on areas that they wish to develop. When working with a given timeframe, we aim to get everything completed before the week of submission so that we have enough time to finalise and review our work.

          <p>When beginning to build and develop the mechanics of our game, it makes sense to be working on each section in pairs. The reasoning behind this is because within that pair, there will be one person who's confident and familiar with coding, working alongside with someone who lacks the skills. This concept will balance out the workload as it requires us to be working together as a team and also allows people to develop the skills that they wish to improve on. It also allows those who are more capable to share the workload rather than take on everything alone.
          Two people working on each section will also increase group productivity and have things completed quicker and more efficiently.</p>

The members whose strength lie in coding and game development will take the lead when working with a partner who is less skilled because this dynamic will allow both participants to learn and develop their skills that they would like to improve. It make not necessarily be skills that's required to develop the game but possibly skills that'll help in your everyday lifestyle (such as; teaching/leadership skills)
          Working in pairs to complete each section that's required to be complete this week will increase our chances of finishing things earlier.
          We've also tried to plan things out in the way where we aim to get the harder tasks out the way so that we would not have to rush and overwork ourselves within the last 2 weeks of the project.</p>
