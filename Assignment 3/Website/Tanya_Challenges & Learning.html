<h2>Challenges and Learning</h2>

<p>Prior to working on this project I thought that working with a group of people I’ve never met or have even seen before would be difficult. I didn’t have many expectations, but I wasn’t sure how the group dynamic would be since, in the previous semester I was able to work in a group with my friends that I’ve met prior to any tasks that were assigned. However, after having met each group member, I found it easy to get along with everyone and seek help if I ever needed any.</p>

<p>Some of the challenges that I was expecting when working on this project was mostly time management. I was worried that we have overlooked the amount of work versus the amount of time we actually have to complete each task, however this was easily resolved by making minor adjustments to our project plans so that we’re able to produce enough quality work within the remaining time we have left.</p>

<p>The timetable that we have developed at the beginning of the project seemed realistic at the time, however that was produced without the consideration of any other external factors that could have gotten in the way of our work. Looking back at it now, there would definitely be changes to how much work we set ourselves each week - something more realistically and easily achievable.</p>

<p>Despite all the challenges and obstacles that we may have faced, working together with the team ‘Technical Techies’ I was able to learn a lot and develop both my HTML skills and time management. </p>
