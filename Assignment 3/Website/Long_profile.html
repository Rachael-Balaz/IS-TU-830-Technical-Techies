<p>Before taking the project my interest is Game Designer which is a person who has knowledge about game coding and designing however at that time both of my skill is not balanced, my design aspect was a bit lower than coding.</p>
<p>To be more clear,  I think my weak points are in-depth of the fundamental of art since I'm don't have an art background and I started to have interest in them this year. Furthermore, since I have been self-learning so I may have not got to know the industry-standard skills better than other university students of that major. Another weakness of me that I think of that is since as a solo developer I have to learn everything that is needed to make a game so even though I can use a variety of different type of software to create a certain quality of works but I don't specialise in any specific skills for game development.</p>
<p>Thought out this project I'm hoping that I have more chances to practice my modelling skills as well as become better as using Unity since Unity functionality is massive. Throughout the project, as a Game Designer and Programmer, Web programmer by getting evolved more in the intense workload, I got a chance to pushed myself further. Even though I tried to surpass weakness is designing but I also don't forget to improve my coding like C#, HTML, CSS, Javascript. </p>
