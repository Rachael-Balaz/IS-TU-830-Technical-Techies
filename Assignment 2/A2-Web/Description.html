       <h1>PROJECT DESCRIPTION</h1>
       <h2>Plunderer is a PC platformer game made by Technical Techies. Control the knight and make your way through the castle to obtain all the treasure your heart's desires</h2>
        <p>Using the Unity, a game making engine that utilises the language C#, the knight will be controlled by players using the keyboard and mouse to move across the level, jump from platform to platform, dodge enemies, and collect items. Making use of Unity's inbuilt physics engine, the knight will jump and fall in a realistic way, in accordance to a gravity variable. Set in a fantasy world, environments, the knight, enemies and items will be designed around this setting to create an immersive experience.</p>
        <h2>There are three types of gamers Plunderer has taken into consideration:</h2>
        <p>As a beginner gamer, they would want a game that does not have difficult controls or complicated mechanics, so that they can understand the game easily and be able to finish the game and not give up, being forced to make complicated movements. Given how they would like a game built around the basic mechanics of platformers, we designed a tutorial that demonstrates all the skills that the player will need to play the game.</p>
        <p>As an intermediate gamer, they would want a game that they can enjoy playing, where it is not too difficult but does give a bit of a challenge, so that it can be played in intervals or be picked back up after a duration away. Given how they would like a game that is not too difficult but not completely easy, we designed the levels in a way that promotes exploring, yielding more possible treasures for the high cost of running into more enemies and traps.</p>
        <p>As an experienced gamer, they would want a challenge from the game as they would already know and play a lot of these games. They would want a game that is difficult for them but not impossible to complete. Given how they want a game to challenge them, a possible extended feature is a hard mode that would either decrease the amount of health of the character or kill them in one hit.</p>
