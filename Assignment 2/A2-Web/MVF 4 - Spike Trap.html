<h1>MVF 4 - Enemies And Traps - Spike Trap</h1>
<p>The Spike trap is a common obstacle the player character will come across on their journey, this trap will be clearly visible to the player even when retracted as the design will be clearly different from normal floor tiles and should intuitively be something the player knows to avoid. The sharp nails of the trap will “spike” out and retract periodically or they could also permanently be out to provide a challenge to the player. Not only could this trap be on the floor it can also be on the walls and ceiling, making its application and potential diverse. Since the trap is either static or slowly periodically protruding/retracting, the consequence of the player touching the spikes would be instant death and reset to the checkpoint, regardless of the players health. This is because the “Traps effective area” is limited so the punishment should be more severe. </p>
<p>The design of this trap was inspired by lots of other games of a similar genre, the spike trap is a staple of the platforming genre and is required to increase the games difficulty. Without something to obstruct the player, the games difficulty would drastically reduce. As the setting of the game is inside a medieval castle, the appearance of iron spikes as traps, is a believable occurrence and helps to immerse the player in the world building of the game. </p>
<p>As a Player of the game “Plunderer”, I need to jump/get past the spike trap obstacles without touching them in order to achieve the current objective and progress the story of the game. Meaning that the successful implementation of the spike trap can be validated by having the player character touch the spikes. If the player character is killed and sent back to the checkpoint upon contact, then it is working as intended. </p>
