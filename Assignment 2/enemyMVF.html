<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Enemies are one of the main obstacles for a player. Enemies will be developed to obstruct players, slow them down, create challenges and prevent them from completing the level with ease. They will come into contact with the player if they are close enough and deal with a fair bit of damages to present players with a challenge. Each type of enemy will have different attack mechanics and difficulty which allows players to explore a variety of experiences while playing the game. Some enemies may require them to be more cautious each time they are dealt with damages by any type of enemy. The few enemies that we have designed will have patrol mechanics which allows them to wander in certain areas in order to guard and wait for players to approach, then a detect system will cause the enemy to attack if a player is within a certain range. However, the pathing given to the enemies should not be too hard to read, or too difficult to pass through, as it will be difficult for beginner players to recognise them.</p>
<h3>Enemy #1 - Poisonous Spiders</h3>
<p>The first enemy design is poisonous spiders and their attack includes spitting out venom that players will need to try their best to avoid. The consequences of being hit by their attack will cause a decline in the player’s health.</p>

<h3>Enemy #2 - Gigantic Ogres</h3>
<p>The second enemy design are gigantic ogres who patrol the castles. Their powers include physical attacks such as using clubs to try and hit the player character. Due to their mass power, the players could potentially feel the game ‘shaking’ as the ogres take their hit.</p>


<h2>Validation Criteria</h2>
<p>Enemies will follow the path that they are allocated to, and not be impeded by level assets or clip through parts of the level. Beginner players should be able to recognise the paths the enemies come from and be able to evade them in order to complete the level. If a player is to be damaged, the player character’s health will decrease.
