      <h2>Extended Features:</h2>
         <p>In the first Extended Feature, our plan is about to enlarge our game from the quantity we are producing since our time constraint is limited we won't be able to make every section of the game. More specifically this extend feature we are focus to complete our game by adding more levels, challenges, obstacles extend the story making the game even more interesting. To validate this section is working during we will go using the Controllable character to go thought the new section to see if any "rabbit holes" that we are missing in the level design such as the setting of the lightning or set all the objects incorrect places and working fine if they have any functions.</p>
         <p>In the second Extended Feature, we planned to provide players extra helps with new additionals gears/ items with different abilities. For example, shoes that allow the player to double jumps or a shield that can give him one extra life. To validate if this feature is working those new items will be tested and used in many circumstances by playing them to see if there are any bugs to fixed and they are working correctly.
        </p>
        <p>In the third Extended Feature, checkpoints will be implemented that player can use to save their current progress since the game or level currently will be reset when player death. By having this feature player can have less stress while enjoying the game. However, the no checkpoint feature can be kept and implement as a new difficulty to the game creating a challenging atmosphere for hardcore players. To validate if this feature is working we will testing by changing the game state in many different ways, for example, taking different paths, using random items then go to the checkpoints and save the game then load the game back to see if those changed it applied before saved the game</p>
