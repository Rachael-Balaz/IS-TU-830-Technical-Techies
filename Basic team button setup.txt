I stayed in Taiwan for 2 years with my grandparents and then moved back to Australia with my parents. My first real contact with IT was when I was 7 years old and I saw my father playing StarCraft and I was completely amazed at the world and endless possibilities that existed inside my father’s metal square box. Ever since then I was always keenly interested in anything technology wise. As I grew older and encountered more and more technology, I was amazed at the infinite possibilities that IT could provide, and I realized that I wanted to pursue IT as my career."

While I am still lacking in coding and programming skills, as I have only started my pursuit for IT. I am confident in being able to help the team achieve its goals no matter how much effort it takes. Since I am new to coding, I am not yet confident about my programming abilities, I hope to be able to learn and improve my programming abilities, and be put into a role that will test and improve my programming abilities."

While I am good at project writeups, and completely willing to help complete some of the written work, I believe being put in an assistant programmer role will help me get used to coding and programing."

    document.getElementById('p1').innerHTML = "I'm an international student from Vietnam. My hobby is Anime, Digital Design, Games, Technology. On my free time, I often go online researching, learning things on different communities to develop my skills. Sometimes, I used games as a way to sustain my friendship and observe how other developers work. Since I am also really into Game programming, I'm currently doing a project on my own, it is an RPG fantasy game using Unity Engine. Currently, I'm working on the game assets to make the game more unique than other games on the market."

    document.getElementById('p3').innerHTML = "I think my weak points are in-depth of the fundamental of art since I'm don't have an art background and I started to have interest in them this year. Furthermore, since I have been self-learning so I may have not got to know the industry-standard skills better than other university students of that major. Another weakness of me that I think of that is since as a solo developer I have to learn everything that is needed to make a game so even though I can use a variety of different type of software to create a certain quality of works but I don't specialise in any specific skills for game development. Thought out this project I'm hoping that I have more chances to practice my modelling skills as well as become better as using Unity since Unity functionality is massive."
    document.getElementById('p4').style.display='block'
        document.getElementById('p4').innerHTML = "One of the challenge for me in the project it may be team communication. Even though I have been in Australia for a while but I and most of my friends are not native English speakers, the way that we discuss in English is has a different quality. So sometimes it quite hard for me to state my points correctly to them."

    document.getElementById('p5').innerHTML = "Luckily, our team project is also about game development which also related to my experiences so I can see my self can be helpful to the team with many specific tasks like Level Design, 3D modelling to create assets and environments. Thought out this project I'm hoping on sharpening my skills to be more ready for industry."
