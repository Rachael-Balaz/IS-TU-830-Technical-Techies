[Background and Passion in IT]
I am of Vietnamese and Yugoslavian descent, but was born and raised in Melbourne, Australia. I like to spend my free time reading, playing videogames, baking, and looking for new recipes to try. I was always fascinated with all the different applications for IT and how they could be used to benefit other sectors. Such as how things video games, which have been only seen as a means of entertainment, are now being used in the medical sector as a means for rehabilitation and for surgeons to improve their performance. My interest in IT was probably linked to my early interest in science that I picked up through watching shows such as "Backyard Science".

[What are you good at/interested in?]


[What are your weaker points in the context of the project needs]
My weak points in the context of the project would be in coding, as I am fairly unfamiliar with bit coding projects and not very confident in my coding skills in general.

[What role do you expect to be performing in the project]
I expect my main role to be in coding the game as it is what I am less experienced in. I might be helping those who are working on the design aspects as I have some experience in design.
