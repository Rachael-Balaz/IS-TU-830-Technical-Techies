<h1>Collaborative Workspaces</h1>
<p>Our group has decided to use a variety of workspaces to keep track of our project progress.</p>
<p>We used Trello to keep track of the progress of the project.   https://trello.com/b/LIBAkstt/bits-assignment-technical-techies</p>
<p>We also used Google Doc to brainstorm, collaborate and write down ideas for the assignment.   https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-jxA_nZORoVq9SmtN79N7llXT6MCmSMSLOMlDZt04_A/edit</p>
<p>The website and project files are uploaded to GitHub.   https://github.com/Rachael-Balaz/IS-TU-830-Technical-Techies</p>
<p>To have meetings and message each other we utilised Microsoft Teams.</p>
