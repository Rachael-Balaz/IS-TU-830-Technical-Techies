<p>My passion for IT stems from me being a creative person but it also stems from the idea that technology has the ability to significantly impact lives and I also aspire to make a great impact in my future career. I am particularly interested in design as it has more room for expressiveness and allows me to use my creativity to solve problems when necessary.</p>

<p>My skills prior to working on this project included basic programming in HTML and JAVA language that I have learnt from the previous semester. My strength lies more in the design aspect of things, specifically digital illustration using Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator and Procreate. Through the completion of this project, I hope to improve my programming skills and broaden my scope of knowledge.</p>

<p>My main role for this project is to design a few of the assets and maintain group organisation. I mostly worked on designing characters that would be included into the game such as the main player character and some enemies. With regards to maintaining group organisation, I often took the lead in setting ourselves dates and deadlines so that we each knew what needed to be completed and when it needed to be completed. We were able to complete all tasks on time whilst taking into consideration external factors. In addition to these roles, I have also worked on each few of the written sections for each assignment that lead up to this project.</p>
