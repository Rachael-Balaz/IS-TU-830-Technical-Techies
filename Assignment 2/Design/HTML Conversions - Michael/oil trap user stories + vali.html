<h1>MV5 - Obstacles/Traps</h1>

<h2> User stories: </h2>
<p>As a player, I want the oil trap to function as intended so I can have a fun experience. <p>
<p>As a player, I want the oil trap to have visually appealing sprites so it is aesthetically engaging. </p>
<p>As a player, I want the oil trap to provide a degree of challenge to my gameplay so it can feel satisfying when I can overcome the trap.</p>

<h2> User scenario: </h2>
<p>A player could trigger a pressure plate, releasing the oil from the above ceiling, drenching the character in oil. This could occur in the first level of the game. </p>

<h2> Validation: </h2>
<p> The aforementioned user stories briefly acknowledge the core, defining characteristics of an effective trap. </p> 
<p> Firstly, the oil trap must perform its functions without error. For example, there should be no bugs and it should coat the player in oil to slow down their movement. </p> 
<p> Secondly, the oil sprites must be visually striking. This means that the sprites themselves might have a bit of a sheen to them and catch the eye of the player, enriching their engagement with the game. </p> 
<p> Thirdly, a trap must add a layer of difficulty for the game. A trap that does not slow down the player enough would not be satisfying to overcome, but a trap that does effect the player and is considered an obstacle would be satisfying to beat. </p>
