       <h1>PROJECT DESCRIPTION</h1>
       <h2>Plunderer is a PC platformer game made by Technical Techies. Control the knight and make your way through the castle to obtain all the treasure your heart's desires</h2>
        <p>Using the Unity, a game making engine that utilises the language C#, the knight will be controlled by players using the keyboard and mouse to move across the level, jump from platform to platform, dodge enemies, and collect items. Making use of Unity's inbuilt physics engine, the knight will jump and fall in a realistic way, in accordance to a gravity variable. Set in a fantasy world, environments, the knight, enemies and items will be designed around this setting to create an immersive experience.</p>
        <h2>There are three types of gamers Plunderer has taken into consideration:</h2>
        <p>As a beginner gamer, they would want a game that does not have difficult controls or complicated mechanics, so that they can understand the game easily and be able to finish the game and not give up, being forced to make complicated movements. Given how they would like a game built around the basic mechanics of platformers, we designed a tutorial that demonstrates all the skills that the player will need to play the game.</p>
        <p>As an intermediate gamer, they would want a game that they can enjoy playing, where it is not too difficult but does give a bit of a challenge, so that it can be played in intervals or be picked back up after a duration away. Given how they would like a game that is not too difficult but not completely easy, we designed the levels in a way that promotes exploring, yielding more possible treasures for the high cost of running into more enemies and traps.</p>
        <p>As an experienced gamer, they would want a challenge from the game as they would already know and play a lot of these games. They would want a game that is difficult for them but not impossible to complete. Given how they want a game to challenge them, a possible extended feature is a hard mode that would either decrease the amount of health of the character or kill them in one hit.</p>
        <h1>TECHNOLOGIES & ARCHITECTURE</h1>
        <h3>Resourcess & Tools name</h3>

          <h2>Short description</h2>
          <h3>Github/Desktop</h3>
          <a href="https://github.com/">https://github.com/</a>
          <p>Github is a command-line tool repository hosting service, We use Github as a place to store and manage our project files. Github allows us to track and modify our work while other team members can track the process of changes to know about the files updates. One of the reasons we chose it since it's free along with the popular and trusts in the coding community as well as how easy and convenient it is to use.</p>
          <h3>Unity</h3>
          <a href="https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download">https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download</a>
          <p>Unity is one of the best engines for game development has been using from idle to top lead company in the industry. Its can be used to create a variety of game type such as three-dimensional, two-dimensional, virtual reality, and augmented reality games, as well as simulations and other experiences. Furthermore, the engine also can be used to create films, automotive, architecture, engineering and construction. We chose to use it because it's suitable for beginners to senior game developer as well as the language that its support which is C# it's similar to Java that we learned in RMIT so its faster for the team to adapt than other engines like Unreal which is using C++ or Godot is Python as Their primary supported language. Along with that Unity Community also very active that can help other people swiftly. </p>
          <h3>Blender</h3>
          <a href="https://www.blender.org/download/">https://www.blender.org/download/</a>
          <p>Blender is a free open source 3D creation software that supports multiple 3D pipelines- modelling, rigging, animation, simulation, rendering, compositing and motion tracking, even video editing and game creation. It's popular because of that multi-purpose support feature and no fee needed to download. Normally if you are not using Blender then the workflow to create a complete model for a game, multiple different types of software is needed to complete a functional model like AutoDesk 3D Max and Maya are for 3D modelling, rigging, animation, Substance Painter is to texture paint the model and Marmoset Toolbag for rendering purpose, sometimes Zbrush is also needed for sculpting 3D model. </p>
          <h3>Zbrush</h3>
          <a href="https://www.zbrushcentral.com/">https://www.zbrushcentral.com/</a>
          <p>Zbrush is specialised software for sculpting 3d model. By using Zbrush we will be able to sculpt our own project assets. Even though Blender does support sculpting feature. However, those features are not as in-depth as Zbrush since it has so many features compared to Blender for sculpting. More than that, Zbrush can handle highly detailed model than Blender. </p>
          <h3>Substance Painter</h3>
          <a href="https://www.substance3d.com/products/substance-painter/">https://www.substance3d.com/products/substance-painter/</a>
          <p>Substance Painter is also an industry-standard software that use to texture paint 3d object. Because of the trustworthy and ease of use with useful functions to help texture paint more comfortable and faster are the reasons along with the experiences our team member had so we chose it. Photoshop is a graphic editor that's used for digital art and graphics editing that we will use to design UI for our project. Mainly we chose it since most of us are familiar with it than other software</p>
          <h3>Mixamo</h3>
          <a href="https://www.mixamo.com/#/">https://www.mixamo.com/#/</a>
          <p>Mixamo is an automatic software that rigged and animate 3D model that we decided to use to reduce our workload.However, later on we will use Blender to design our character animation</p>
          <h3>Photoshop</h3>
          <a href="https://www.adobe.com/au/products/photoshop.html">https://www.adobe.com/au/products/photoshop.html</a>

          <h3>Visual Studio Code</h3>

          <h3>Synty Studio Assests </h3>

          <a href="https://syntystore.com/products/polygon-dungeon-pack">https://syntystore.com/products/polygon-dungeon-pack</a>
          <p>Since this is a time limited, short of designer in our team and we need to focus more on coding, so we decided to use one of our teammates resources that he bought for his personal project that made by Synty Studio. However, those assests are only included ground materials, props, building,trees in order to make sure user see our original of our game we still design our own assets to the game such as: Main Character, Enemies, Health, Traps they are also our Mininum Viable Feautures.</p>
