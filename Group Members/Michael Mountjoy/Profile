My ethnic background is a mix between Italian and British. I am passionate in the gaming industry within I.T. Additionally, Java and functional programming like F# has been fascinating to learn.

I am still considered a beginner in programming and I.T but I am excited to learn more about programming and how to make video games, like through unity.

I hope to develop vital skills and experience relevant to creating video games throughout the course of this assignment. The way I see this happening is using the unity engine to create assets, mechanics, scripts and content with supplementary programming through collaboration with my group members.

My challenges in the context of this project is navigating HTML and CSS due to my limited usage of it. Considering I do not have much experience of Unity, this will be an invaluable learning experience for me as I understand its functions and how it works.

Throughout this project, I will try to work on all areas that need improvement, like learning how to code more and perhaps working on the design aspect of the project.
