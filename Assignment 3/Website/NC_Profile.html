<h3>Interest</h3>
<p>Coming from a previous degree in game development, creating games has always been interesting to me. Creating a platformer game is also something I have not done myself and seems like a fairly fun project.</p>

<h3>IPrevious Skills</h3>
<p>I have experience using Unity to develop games and C# as a programming language. I’ve used these when working with a group to create games collaboratively. Source control was a very important part of my previous projects and while I have not used Github for this purpose, the functionality is similar.</p>

<h3>Acquired Skills</h3>
<p>I have become more confident in leading a team as well as expressing my opinion.</p>

<h3>Assigned Role</h3>
<p>My assigned role for the project was team lead, as I was one of two people with previous experience on this type of project. This involved leading team meetings to keep them structured, assigning work to be done for the week and helping others with issues that come up. I’ve also used my previous skills to program features for the project and to help others with their own programming.</p>
