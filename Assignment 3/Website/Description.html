<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The idea of developing a PC platformer game was initially suggested as each member of our group has a common interest for gaming and design. We wanted to work on a project that we’re passionate about and explore how IT and design can produce such an addicting form of entertainment and enjoyment. </p>

<p>At the beginning of our project, we found ourselves having a rougher start than many other teams as the gaming concept is a very broad field and we took a little while to narrow down our ideas. However, once we had decided upon the narrative and concept of our game, we managed to work through each assignment at a steady pace. We were moving forward and making progress with our project, dealing with new challenges and coming up with new solutions to handle the obstacles we had come across.</p>

<p>With regards to how we progressed with the plan that we’ve developed earlier on, there were definitely adjustments made to suit our current timeline. Following the original plan, there is no denying that there were times that we may have fallen a little behind schedule, whether it may be due to a personal matter or a series of other assignments that are also due around the same time but in the end, we always manage to pull through and complete whatever needs to be done. This may have required various check in meetings with the group, but as a team we’ve always done our best to carry our weight and produce the quality of work that we’d all be proud of to submit. In each group meeting, we always aim to discuss our future plans and what should be done by the next week – by adapting to our timetables this way, we’re able to work more efficiently. Of course, there are still deadlines we set ourselves but we have realised that it can be difficult to sync everyone’s agenda hence, we’ve been following a constant weekly plan.</p>

<p>A few pivotal decisions that we’ve made to the original project plan was changing one of our MVF ideas into an EVF, combining two MVFs into one and dividing another MVF into two.</p>
<ul>
  <li>MVF 3 (First level) was changed into an EVF</li>
  <li>MVF 5 (Enemies and traps) was changed into 2 separate MVFs</li>
  <li>MVF 4 (Health mechanic) + MVF 6 (Death handling) combined into 1 MVF</li>
</ul>  

<p>The reasoning behind this decision was because we overestimated what we were able to achieve within the amount of time we were given to work on this entire project. From planning to designing, and then working to develop the prototypes before we can even begin our presentation assignment. The first two assignments of planning and the designing of our project was a reasonable amount of work that we were able to steadily work through, however for the development of our prototypes, we came to realise that we may have led on more than we could actually handle. With less than 4 weeks to develop functional mock-ups and the written report, amidst the same time we have other assignments due as well. Hence, making these changes have allowed us to work efficiently with the time that we have left to work on this assignment. We also chose to change things around so that we would not have to rush any of our prototypes and present a poorly made prototype of our game.</p>

<p>Ultimately, we would have liked to achieve developing the first level of the game which was initially an MVF, however due to an overestimation of the time that we had left to develop the prototypes, we realised that we were not able to complete given the remaining few weeks we have to work on everything – especially since we set out to develop 6 MVFs to begin with.</p>
