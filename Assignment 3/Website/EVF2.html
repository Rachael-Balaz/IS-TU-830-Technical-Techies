<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Ability items are additional elements that are made to assist players in completing obstacles and progressing throughout the game. There will be multiple items, all of which contain different ‘powers/abilities’ that will support and enhance a player’s performance. Some may allow a player to progress at a faster speed, give them high/double jump capabilities, give them full immunity to any threats or some may even allow them to rejuvenate their health but all items are only effective temporarily. When a player obtains an ability item, they will experience the effects of that specific item for a short period of time and are required to make the most use of that ability before the duration of the effects run out.</p>

<h3>Ability Item #1 -</h3>
<p>This ability item is in the form of a ‘potion bottle’ and its effect will enhance a player’s performance by increasing the speed at which they progress throughout the level. This may benefit a player’s completion time.</p>

<h3>Ability Item #2 -</h3>
<p>This ability item is in the form of a ‘potion bottle’ and will give players the ability to jump higher (than the standard jump control) in order to successfully handle a variety of obstacles.</p>

<h3>Ability Item #3 -</h3>
<p>This ability item is in the form of a ‘potion bottle’ and will allow players total immunity for a short period of time. In cases where the player will come into contact with threats such as enemies or traps, they’ll be able to run by it without any health damage if they’re under the effects of an ability item.</p>

<h3>Ability Item #4 -</h3>
<p>This ability item is also in the form of a ‘potion bottle’ and it will instantly restore a player’s health bar at its fullest capacity. This will benefit a play by reducing their probability of dying earlier in the game.</p>

<h3>Ability Item #5 -</h3>
<p>This ability item is in the form of food products, such as fruits and meat. The effects of these items will slowly increase a fraction of the player’s health. This is different to ability item #4 as it does not fully restore a player's health but only a small portion of it, hence the possibility of handling great damages is still probable. </p>

<h2>User Story</h2>
<p>As a player, I want to be able to use each ability item to my advantage in order to successfully complete a level.</p>

<h2>User Scenario</h2>
<p>Player practices tutorial level - Given I attempt to complete the tutorial level, I will need to jump, run and evade any obstacles I am to encounter. When I obtain an ability item and am faced with challenges such as traps and enemies, I'll need to manipulate the ability item that I’ve collected in a way that will increase my chances of success for the completion of this level.  After the ability item has lost its effects, I will have completed the objective of this level with the extra support of such advantageous items.</p>

<h2>Validation Criteria</h2>
<p>Ability items will be specifically allocated at certain locations in the games and players will where come to find them as they progress throughout the game. These items should be visible enough for players to recognise what it is that they are running towards. Once having obtained these items, players are expected to effectively use the ability that they are granted with to their advantage in order to successfully complete the level.</p>
