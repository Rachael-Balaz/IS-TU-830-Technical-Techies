    document.getElementById('p1').innerHTML = "I was born in Australia but after birth I moved to Taiwan to live with my grandparents for a few years as my parents in Australia did not have time to look after me due to work. I stayed in Taiwan for 2 years with my grandparents and then moved back to Australia with my parents. My first real contact with IT was when I was 7 years old and I saw my father playing StarCraft and I was completely amazed at the world and endless possibilities that existed inside my father's metal square box. Ever since then I was always keenly interested in anything technology wise. As I grew older and encountered more and more technology, I was amazed at the infinite possibilities that IT could provide, and I realized that I wanted to pursue IT as my career."
    document.getElementById('p2').innerHTML = "I believe that I am good at delegating and coordinating with the team. While I am still lacking in coding and programming skills, as I have only started my pursuit for IT. I am confident in being able to help the team achieve its goals no matter how much effort it takes. Since I am new to coding, I am not yet confident about my programming abilities, I hope to be able to learn and improve my programming abilities, and be put into a role that will test and improve my programming abilities."
    document.getElementById('p3').innerHTML = "Since I am not confident in the programing and coding department this project will be a challenge, I believe I should take on a role that will expose me to the coding and programing side of the project as it will help me learn and develop confidence in coding. While I am good at project writeups, and completely willing to help complete some of the written work, I believe being put in an assistant programmer role will help me get used to coding and programing."

function LongInfo()
{
	document.getElementById("pic").src = "Profile\\Long.jpg"
    document.getElementById('p1').innerHTML = "I'm an international student from Vietnam. My hobby is Anime, Digital Design, Games, Technology. On my free time, I often go online researching, learning things on different communities to develop my skills. Sometimes, I used games as a way to sustain my friendship and observe how other developers work. Since I am also really into Game programming, I'm currently doing a project on my own, it is an RPG fantasy game using Unity Engine. Currently, I'm working on the game assets to make the game more unique than other games on the market."
    document.getElementById('p2').innerHTML = "I been working on my self-project a while so I got a good among of understanding about game development workflow and knowing how to use software that required to make my game such as 3d modelling software: Substance Painter, Blender, Zbrush and Unity as a game engine for my game."
    document.getElementById('p3').innerHTML = "I think my weak points are in-depth of the fundamental of art since I'm don't have an art background and I started to have interest in them this year. Furthermore, since I have been self-learning so I may have not got to know the industry-standard skills better than other university students of that major. Another weakness of me that I think of that is since as a solo developer I have to learn everything that is needed to make a game so even though I can use a variety of different type of software to create a certain quality of works but I don't specialise in any specific skills for game development. Thought out this project I'm hoping that I have more chances to practice my modelling skills as well as become better as using Unity since Unity functionality is massive."
    document.getElementById('p4').style.display='block'
    document.getElementById('p4').innerHTML = "One of the challenge for me in the project it may be team communication. Even though I have been in Australia for a while but I and most of my friends are not native English speakers, the way that we discuss in English is has a different quality. So sometimes it quite hard for me to state my points correctly to them."
    document.getElementById('p5').style.display='block'
    document.getElementById('p5').innerHTML = "Luckily, our team project is also about game development which also related to my experiences so I can see my self can be helpful to the team with many specific tasks like Level Design, 3D modelling to create assets and environments. Thought out this project I'm hoping on sharpening my skills to be more ready for industry."

    document.getElementById('p1').innerHTML = "My ethnic background is a mix between Italian and British. I am passionate in the gaming industry within I.T. Additionally, Java and functional programming like F# has been fascinating to learn."
    document.getElementById('p2').innerHTML = "I am still considered a beginner in programming and I.T but I am excited to learn more about programming and how to make video games, like through unity."
    document.getElementById('p3').innerHTML = "I hope to develop vital skills and experience relevant to creating video games throughout the course of this assignment. The way I see this happening is using the unity engine to create assets, mechanics, scripts and content with supplementary programming through collaboration with my group members."
    document.getElementById('p4').style.display='block'
    document.getElementById('p4').innerHTML = "My challenges in the context of this project is navigating HTML and CSS due to my limited usage of it. Considering I do not have much experience of Unity, this will be an invaluable learning experience for me as I understand its functions and how it works."
    document.getElementById('p5').style.display='block'
    document.getElementById('p5').innerHTML = "Throughout this project, I will try to work on all areas that need improvement, like learning how to code more and perhaps working on the design aspect of the project."

function NathanInfo()
{

    document.getElementById('p1').innerHTML = "I grew up playing video games as many other people did. In high school I took different IT classes and decided to go to the Academy of Interactive Entertainment to learn about game development, specifically programming. It was enjoyable but decided to try find a better career by coming to RMIT."
    document.getElementById('p2').innerHTML = "I have a good understanding of programming aspects and developing a product. I'm interested in learning different aspects of IT such as networks, databases and IoT."
    document.getElementById('p3').innerHTML = "I've worked on developing games before but haven't worked on designing the features of a game or leading a project."
    document.getElementById('p4').style.display='block'
    document.getElementById('p4').innerHTML = "Games have many features implemented that make the development cycle longer than some expect. As our team isn't very experienced in this process, the game could take longer than we realise to develop. This means that we'll need to be very organised."
    document.getElementById('p5').style.display='block'
    document.getElementById('p5').innerHTML = "I can see myself trying to bring the team together in order to focus us. I'd like to take on a more designer role but with my experience I'm also willing to do some development or helping others develop their programming skills."

function RachaelInfo()
{ 
    document.getElementById("pic").src = "Profile\\Racheal.jpg"
    document.getElementById('p1').innerHTML = "I am of Vietnamese and Yugoslavian descent, but was born and raised in Melbourne, Australia. I like to spend my free time reading, playing videogames, baking, and looking for new recipes to try. I was always fascinated with all the different applications for IT and how they could be used to benefit other sectors. Such as how things video games, which have been only seen as a means of entertainment, are now being used in the medical sector as a means for rehabilitation and for surgeons to improve their performance. My interest in IT was probably linked to my early interest in science that I picked up through watching shows such as Backyard Science."
    document.getElementById('p2').innerHTML = "I have experience in design and I am interested in applying those skills in an IT setting. I am also interested in improving my knowledge in programming."
    document.getElementById('p3').innerHTML = "My weak points in the context of the project would be in coding, as I am fairly unfamiliar with bit coding projects and not very confident in my coding skills in general."
    document.getElementById('p4').style.display='block'
    document.getElementById('p4').innerHTML = "I expect my main role to be in coding the game as it is what I am less experienced in. I might be helping those who are working on the design aspects as I have some experience in design."

function TanyaInfo()

    document.getElementById('p2').innerHTML = "My passion for IT stems from me being a creative person and I aspire to make a very big impact in my future career. I want to be at the forefront of technology and use my creativity to help solve problems of the future."
    document.getElementById('p3').innerHTML = "In terms of skills, my strengths lie in creativity particularly through visual artforms such as drawing and digital illustration (2D). I have an interest for art and design because it's a form of expression and I'm constantly exposed to lots of things that I can easily draw inspiration from."
    document.getElementById('p4').style.display='block'
    document.getElementById('p4').innerHTML = "In the context of what this project requires, I'm the least confident with my coding and programming skills. I'm also not an avid gamer like the rest of my group members so I also lack the knowledge in gaming. However, through the progression of this project, I would like to improve my coding and programming skills and broaden my scope of knowledge."
    document.getElementById('p5').style.display='block'
    document.getElementById('p5').innerHTML = "Working with everyone on this project for the next couple of weeks, I hope to contribute a lot of my creative design skills when developing the interface for our game but, I also hope to learn and improve the skills I currently find challenging."
